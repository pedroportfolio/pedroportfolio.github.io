			<h3>What is this?</h3>
			<p>
				In an attempt to improve my CV and challenge myself I decided to learn the basics of programming. This website was my 
				first project. If you'd like to see more projects please click the "Projects"
				button and select a theme. If you would like to get in contact with me feel free to add me on LinkedIn or send me an email. 
			</p>
			
			<h3>A little history</h3>
			<p>
				I was born in Brazil and have had the pleasure of living in six countries. These include Brazil, Argentina, Peru, the United States, 
				Angola, and the Netherlands. My backaground makes it easy for me to work with colleagues and in groups with a variety of backgrounds.
				I currently study international business but have an interest in programming. This is not limited to web development as I've also done projects 
				in python and data management through SQL. My hobbies are biking and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ). I've been practicing BJJ for twelve years and am 
				currently teaching at Apex Jiu Jitsu. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Thanks to BJJ i've learned to breakdown big ideas into small actionable steps anyone can understand. My study gives me a strong foundation in the areas
				of humanities. My interest in programming allows me to expand on that foundation. 
				
			</p>
			
			<p>
				If you think I would be an asset for your company don't hesitate in getting in contact with me.
